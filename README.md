A platformer game with ASCII-like graphics written in Monogame using F#.
I originally made this for GameOff 2018, but never published it, because I did not really finish it in a satisfying manner until the deadline. It is mostly playable now, but not really entertaining. Also, the code is horrible (I was trying to learn F# at the time and this was my first real project).
